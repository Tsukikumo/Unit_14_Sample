# Unit-14-Carly

You will not need any prior code for this lab.

In previous chapters, you have created a number of programs for Carlyâ€™s Catering. Now, create an interactive GUI program that does the following:

JCarlysCatering.java
- Allows the user to enter the number of guests for an event into a text field
  - If the value entered is not numeric, set the event price to 0. 
- Allows the user to choose only one entree from a group of at least four choices
- Allows the user to choose up to two side dishes from a group of at least four choices (use JCheckBox for each choice)
  - If a user attempts to choose more than two side dishes, remove all the current side dish selections so that the user can start over. 
- Allows the user to choose only one dessert from a group of at least three choices. 
- At the end of the JFrame, display the following information:
  - The cost of the event as $35 per person
  - A list of the current items chosen that continues to update as the user makes changes to their choices.
